# My name is Joshua, and I am mostly interested by rendering, graphics APIs and video game programming !
I am looking a position as a Real-time graphics programmer or an Engine programmer.

In the context of my studies, we are currently developing a multiplayer game on Unreal Engine 5. 
I was also able to study and learn about quantum computing in the context of an internship, where I mainly solved simple Karp's problems using IBM's Qiskit Library.

Alot of my projects are on a private school Gitlab, but you can still find some of them here.

# My relevant works :
- Neon Fever (video presentation soon) , a quake-like 4v4 FPS, inspired by laser tags ! (UE5, C++ 20)

- [Moonstone Engine](https://github.com/YaelGras/BugsBall/tree/main) Where I wrote the whole engine and rendering implementation for a 3D marble-like game (DirectX11, C++ 20)

- [Bugs Balls](https://github.com/YaelGras/BugsBall/tree/main) A marble-like racing game that uses the engine mentionned above.

- [Marble Engine](https://github.com/Akahara/MarbleEngine) I mainly worked on Post-Effects, Terrain Generation, Billboards, Ligthting, Deferred Rendering (OpenGL, C++ 20)

- [glascii](https://github.com/JoshuaVHB/glascii) Where I built a raster pipeline using the windows terminal as a display. I promise gthat one day, I will update this repo with the new code ! (Windows API, C++ 20)

- [LuxAI](https://github.com/YaelGras/LuxAI) Abstracted the world, and implemented Commandant-Squad-Unit behaviours. This was a school competition, and we won :) ! (C++20)

# My strengths
- Strong experience and great understanding of modern C++ and low level programming (Metaprogramming, multithreading, cache, alignement, standard library...)
- Good knowledge about Graphics APIs (OpenGL, DirectX11 / DirectX12) and shader programming (HLSL/GLSL)
- Used UE5 in an actual project environnement (UI, VFX, Gameplay, procedural generation...).
- Experience on rendering techniques (PBR, SSAO, Shadows, Deferred/Forward...)
- Passionate about theory behind rendering and special interest for GI and Post-Effects (Irradiance Caching, VXGI, DDGI, RSM, DOF...)
- Great teamworking experience with project management
- Like to learn new stuff (Quantum computing, PhysX, UE5...)
